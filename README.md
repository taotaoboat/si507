# data structure
The data structure is built along userâ€™s interaction
The user may choose where to start from a list of real interview questions. Then, the user is to build the tree of the path of their study when answering whether they know the answer to the question. Once the user does not know the answer to the question, the question Id will pop up for the user to check the answer. This is a simple binary tree. The user is free to record their learning tree or expend the learning tree.
